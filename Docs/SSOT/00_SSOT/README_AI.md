# ReE Alpha01 - AI Entry (SSOT First)

## 0) Golden Rule
- SSOT is the single source of truth.
- Draft is NOT SSOT. Draft is input material only.

## 1) Start Here (SSOT Entrypoint)
1. Read: `Docs/SSOT/00_SSOT/SSOT_INDEX.md`
   - This file is the canonical navigation for SSOT.

## 2) Core Design Docs (must-read)
- `Docs/SSOT/Design/ReE_確定版_戦闘UI及び戦闘システム_α1.0_2026-01-03.md`
- `Docs/SSOT/Design/ReE_Library_Full_2026-01-08.md`

## 3) SSOT Mirror Location
- Full SSOT mirror: `Docs/SSOT/00_SSOT/00_SSOT/`
  - LORE / WORLD / TEMPLATES and SSOT docx/md live here.

## 4) Draft Policy (Important)
- Draft folder: `Docs/DRAFT/`
- Draft is ignored by git and MUST NOT be treated as SSOT.
- If Draft is used, treat it as "ideas to be proposed", not decisions.

## 5) Change Workflow (Packet-based)
- All work must be one task = one Packet.
- Always declare "what file is superseded" (Supersede Mark).
- Use PR/Update template if available:
  - `AI_DEV/SSOT_UPDATE_PR_INSTRUCTION_TEMPLATE.md`

# ReE_Alpha01 – AGENTS (Local SSOT)

## SSOT (Single Source of Truth)
- SSOT docs live under: `Docs/SSOT/00_SSOT/`
- SSOT entry: `Docs/SSOT/00_SSOT/SSOT_INDEX.md`
- Project rules: `Docs/SSOT/00_SSOT/PROJECT_RULES.md`
- AI reading guide: `Docs/SSOT/00_SSOT/README_AI.md`
- Dev logs: `Docs/Logs_SSOT/`
- Specs (non-SSOT memo): `Docs/Specs/`
- Draft is NOT SSOT: `Docs/DRAFT/` (gitignored)

## Working rules
- Work on branch: `dev`
- 1 task = 1 Packet (write acceptance criteria + test steps)
- If SSOT conflicts with code: STOP and ask which is correct (SSOT-first by default)
